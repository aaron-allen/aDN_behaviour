# aDN_behaviour

Analysis of male courtship behaviour in _Drosophila melanogaster_.

These data and analyses were published in "A sex-specific switch between visual and olfactory inputs underlies adaptive sex differences in behavior" (Nojima and Rings et al., 2021), available [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982220318996?via%3Dihub).

We ran 3 separate experiments:
1. Silencing aDN neurons in males and pairing them with _CS_ females while in light.
2. Silencing aDN neurons in males and pairing them with _CS_ females while in dark.
3. Silencing aDN neurons in females and pairing them with _CS_ males while in light.

In all cases, we then tracked, quantified and analysed the behaviour of the male.
