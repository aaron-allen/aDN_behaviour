# aDN_behaviour

Analysis of male courtship behaviour in _Drosophila melanogaster_.

We ran 3 separate experiments:
1. Silencing aDN neurons in males and pairing them with _CS_ females while in light.
2. Silencing aDN neurons in males and pairing them with _CS_ females while in dark.
3. Silencing aDN neurons in females and pairing them with _CS_ males while in light.

In all cases, we then tracked, quantified and analysed the behaviour of the male.
